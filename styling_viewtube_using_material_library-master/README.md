# ViewTube

## Introduction 

OTT – Over-the-top media is no longer the future of entertainment but is now the reality.​

With over 50% of North Americans maintaining Netflix subscriptions, it is evident that the consumers love OTT content. It is the most popular form of entertainment today across all age groups. ​

All that a consumer needs to have, is a compatible hardware device enabled with a good internet connection.​

An “over-the-top” media service is an online content provider that offers streaming media as a standalone product. An OTT conversation largely revolves around video-on-demand. However, it also supports audio, messaging, and VOIP.​

Any application or service that provides a product over the internet while bypassing traditional media services is an OTT application.​

Popular OTT applications for video streaming are Netflix, Amazon Video, YouTube, HBO, etc.​


## ViewTube - Phase1

Seeing the demand of OTT applications, the team at Ezone Pvt. Ltd., which is popular in providing software solutions in the field of entertainment, has started with a project to develop an OTT application – ViewTube. ​

In the first phase, to stay ahead in the heavily competitive market, the Ezone Pvt. Ltd. wants to release the ViewTube application quickly to market.​

React applications can be designed and styled using material library.

## Problem Statement 

You as a frontend developer have been assigned the responsibility to quickly get the first version of ViewTube ready.​

In the first version, the landing view of the application should be rendered with video cards having brief description, number of views, duration since it was published, and the length of the video.​

3. Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.    
4. The boilerplate consists of the solution code for the ViewTube app.    
5. The boilerplate also contains the `videoData.json` file located inside the data folder.    
6. The video data is by default imported into the component, and you can use those data for directly use.
